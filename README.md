# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an advent calendar format.

## Structure

Each day's puzzle solution is stored in a separate directory named `dayXX` where `XX` is the day of the month. For example, the solution for Day 1 is in the `day01` directory.

```
day01/
day02/
day03/
...
day25/
```

Inside each `dayXX` directory, you will find at least two files:

- `input.txt`: The puzzle input provided by Advent of Code.
- `part1.js`: The JS script that solves the puzzle.

## Usage

To run a solution script, navigate to the corresponding `dayXX` directory and run the JS script. For example:

```bash
cd day01
node part1.py
```

Make sure you have Node installed on your system.
